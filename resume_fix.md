It looks like your `IonicDeeplink` plugin is mainly handling new intents to manage deep link URLs, but it does not explicitly handle the case when the app resumes from the background with a new URL. In order to handle this, we need to ensure that the `handleIntent` method is also called when the activity is resumed with a new intent.

Below, I have fixed the code to include a call to the `handleIntent` method in the `onResume` lifecycle method of the Cordova activity. I've also added some checks and comments to ensure that the code is more robust against potential issues.

```java
// ... (previous code)

@Override
public void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {
  super.onNewIntent(intent);
  this.cordova.getActivity().setIntent(intent); // Ensure any new intent is set as the current one
  handleIntent(intent);
}

@Override
public void onResume(boolean multitasking) {
  super.onResume(multitasking);
  // onResume is called whenever the activity is brought to the foreground, including on app start
  // and when resuming from background. We should check if the activity has been launched with a
  // new intent. To do this, we retrieve the current intent of the activity.
  Intent intent = this.cordova.getActivity().getIntent();
  if (intent != null) {
    handleIntent(intent);
  }
}

// ...

/**
 * Check if we can open an app with a given URI scheme.
 *
 * Thanks to https://github.com/ohh2ahh/AppAvailability/blob/master/src/android/AppAvailability.java
 */
private void canOpenApp(String uri, final CallbackContext callbackContext) {
  Context ctx = this.cordova.getActivity().getApplicationContext();
  final PackageManager pm = ctx.getPackageManager();

  try {
    pm.getPackageInfo(uri, PackageManager.GET_ACTIVITIES);
    callbackContext.success();
    return; // We found the package, so return after calling success
  } catch(PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {
    // The package does not exist so we can't open the app
  }

  callbackContext.error("Could not find package"); // Provide an error message
}

// ... (remaining code)
```

I included the following improvements and fixes in the updated code:

1. Used `super.onNewIntent(intent);` to ensure proper handling of the new intent in the superclass.
2. The new intent is now set as the current one.
3. The `onResume` lifecycle method has been overridden to handle any new intent when the activity comes to the foreground, regardless of whether it's starting or resuming.
4. A return statement after `callbackContext.success();` in `canOpenApp` prevents the error callback from being called after a successful result.
5. An error message is provided in `callbackContext.error()` when the app cannot be opened due to the absence of a package.

Remember that when integrating this fixed code into the existing Android project, it's important to properly test the behavior in both the scenarios of app start and resume from the background since this is critical to the use case of deep linking.
